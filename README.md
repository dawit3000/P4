* ShinyApp Project

* The end product is here [deployed at ShinyApps.io](https://aberra.shinyapps.io/MyCoffeeApp/)

* My Shiny Coffee App reactively renders bar-graphs of "World's Top 10 Coffee Arabica Producers of 2023, and their last 10 years trajectory"

* Both UI and Server scripts of the app are pasted in [app.R as one file in the folder](https://github.com/dawit3000/P4/blob/main/MyCoffeeApp/app.R) 

* Users can directly ran the single app.R file OR may copy and paste segments in UI.R and Server.R files as two different files, with the data producing code pasted at the beginning of each code at the top.

* App.R should be understood as one file with components Ui and Server pasted in it as follows
   - starts by a code that created the data "Coffee"
   - The second segment is UI script
   - The last segment is Server logic
